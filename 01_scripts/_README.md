**Project name:** Productivity and Reproducibility 2024 Final Project 
(short form is "PRClass")

**Date created:** September 10th, 2024

**Created by:** Kelly Balfour

**Date updated:** September 25th, 2024

**Updated by:** Kelly Balfour

**Group members:** Kelly Balfour (this was an independent final project)

**Project description**: This data project is being completed as part of the 
Productivity and Reproducibility course associated with the Living Data Project.
This project uses the "hbr_maples" data set, which is publicly available for use
via the R package "lterdatasampler", to investigate whether calcium addition
influences the plant size and leaf anatomy of *Acer saccharum* (sugar maple)
seedlings.

**Data set description:** The data set used, "hbr_maples", is part of The Long
Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program Network database, which was accessed via
the publicly available R package "lterdatasampler" on September 10th, 2024. The
data set is owned by (1) Stephanie Juice (Cornell University) and (2) Tim Fahey
(Cornell University). Sugar maple seedlings were examined at the Hubbard Brook 
Experimental Forest on calcium-treated and reference sites during August 2003
and June 2004. Seedlings were sampled every ten steps in transects.
