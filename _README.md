This data project is being completed as part of the Productivity and Reproducibility course associated with the Living Data Project.

**Group members:** Kelly Balfour (this was an independent final project)

**Data set information:** The data set used, "hbr_maples", is part of The Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program Network database, which was accessed via the publically available R package "lterdatasampler" on September 10th, 2024. The data set is owned by (1) Stephanie Juice (Cornell University) and (2) Tim Fahey (Cornell University).
