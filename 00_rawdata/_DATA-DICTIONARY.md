**Project description**: This data project is being completed as part of the 
Productivity and Reproducibility course associated with the Living Data Project.
This project uses the "hbr_maples" data set, which is publicly available for use
via the R package "lterdatasampler", to investigate whether calcium addition
influences the plant size and leaf anatomy of *Acer saccharum* (sugar maple)
seedlings.

**Data set description:** The data set used, "hbr_maples", is part of The Long
Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program Network database, which was accessed via
the publicly available R package "lterdatasampler" on September 10th, 2024. The
data set is owned by (1) Stephanie Juice (Cornell University) and (2) Tim Fahey
(Cornell University). Sugar maple seedlings were examined at the Hubbard Brook 
Experimental Forest on calcium-treated and reference sites during August 2003
and June 2004. Seedlings were sampled every ten steps in transects.

**mapledata.csv**

*year*: a number denoting the year that the sample was taken

*watershed*: a factor denoting the watershed where the sample was collected;
W1 = calcium-treated, Reference = reference

*elevation*: a factor describing the Elevation of transect; Low = low elevation,
Mid = mid elevation

*transect*: a factor denoting the transect number within the watershed

*sample*: a factor denoting the sample number within transect. There are twenty
samples in each transect

*stem_length*: a number denoting the height of the seedling in millimeters

*leaf1area*: a number denoting the area of the first sampled leaf in square
centimeters

*leaf2area*: a number denoting the area of the second sampled leaf in square
centimeters

*leaf_dry_mass*: a number denoting the dry mass of both sampled leaves in grams

*stem_dry_mass*: a number denoting the dry mass of the stem in grams

*corrected_leaf_area*: a number denoting the area of both leaves in addition to
the area removed for chlorophyll measurements in square centimeters
