These data are part of The Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program Network database, in a data set called "hbr_maples". The data set is owned by (1) Stephanie Juice (Cornell University) and (2) Tim Fahey (Cornell University). The data set was accessed by Kelly Balfour on September 10th, 2024, from the publicly available R package "lterdatasampler", for use in a final project for the Productivity and Reproducibility 2024 course, associated with the Living Data Project.

Data set description: Sugar maple seedlings were examined at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest on calcium-treated and reference sites during August 2003 and June 2004. Seedlings were sampled every ten steps in transects.

*year*: a number denoting the year that the sample was taken

*watershed*: a factor denoting the watershed where the sample was collected; W1 = calcium-treated, Reference = reference

*elevation*: a factor describing the Elevation of transect; Low = low elevation, Mid = mid elevation

*transect*: a factor denoting the transect number within the watershed

*sample*: a factor denoting the sample number within transect. There are twenty samples in each transect

*stem_length*: a number denoting the height of the seedling in millimeters
